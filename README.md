# [Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-14) Entry

## Building

In order to run build.sh or build.bat, you will need to download a build of odin and place it in
the root directory of the repository, renaming the folder to odin-linux or odin-windows respectively.
The project is built against Odin's 2025-08-21 nightly build.

- [Windows Download](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/odin-binaries/nightly/odin-windows-amd64-nightly%2B2025-08-21.zip)
- [Linux Download](https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/odin-binaries/nightly/odin-linux-amd64-nightly%2B2025-08-21.tar.gz)

Note that for the windows build you should extract the dist folder from the archive and place that in the
project root as odin-windows.
